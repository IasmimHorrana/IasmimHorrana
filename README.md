### Hi there! 🐇

My name is Iasmim Horrana and i started my journey in the IT area between 2015 and 2017, but ended up following other paths. In 2024, I decided to return to the technology sector and am currently studying data science at a college, where I was able to begin to understand various processes in the area.

With the study I have acquired, I feel motivated by the desire to become a Data Engineer. Currently, I am dedicating myself to learning and developing essential skills for this career. I'm excited to explore the vast field of data engineering and contribute to the world of technology.
