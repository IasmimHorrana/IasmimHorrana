### Hi there! 🐇

Hi, I'm Iasmim Horrana. My journey with technology started between 2015 and 2017, but life led me down different paths. In 2024, I chose to return to the tech world with a fresh perspective and a strong desire to build something meaningful.

Today, I’m studying Data Science at college and deepening my knowledge in areas that truly excite me: automation, intelligent agents, and artificial intelligence. I'm especially interested in how these technologies can be used to create practical, efficient solutions that generate real impact.

I’m passionate about learning, experimenting, and finding smart ways to solve everyday problems using tech, and I’m currently exploring how I can turn this passion into useful tools, digital products, or innovative services.
